The program is designed to read through this excel file, 
but the program is written to be easily adapted to any excel file with a similar format.

The program contains input validation, 
so it will automatically print what you typed into the legend with a capitalized first letter,
and typoes are deleted

The graph increases in size depending on how many states are requested.

You will have to change the directory to match your own, containing the excel file.

Its a bit messy, so I may come back and make the code easier to digest in the future.
